Workplace Context
Your team has successfully built a prototype for a new “TaskMaster” application using the MERN stack. The prototype exists on GitHub but has only ever been run on a local machine. Now, the project manager wants to share the prototype with a small group of stakeholders to gather early feedback.

Your task is to take the existing MERN application, which is not yet configured for production, and deploy it to a live, publicly accessible URL using the free tier of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider. This will be the first time the application is live on the internet.

Your Task
For this lab, you will fork a pre-built MERN starter application, configure it, and deploy it to the Render platform. You will need to create a free account with both MongoDB Atlas (for the database) and Render (for hosting) if you have not already done so.

Your goal is to successfully deploy both the backend (as a “Web Service”) and the frontend (as a “Static Site”) and connect them so that you 
have a functional, live application.

Assignment Resources
Starter Application: simple-mern on GitHub 
Deployment Guide: Deploying Your MERN Stack Application on Render 
MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database  (You will need to create a free account and a new cluster)

Render: PaaS Hosting  (You will need to create a free account)
Steps to Complete
Fork and Clone: Fork the simple-mern repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine.
Create Database: Set up a new, free-tier cluster on MongoDB Atlas. Create a database and a collection for this project. Make sure to get the connection string.
Follow the Guide: Carefully follow the deployment guide to deploy your application to Render. This will involve:
Creating a Web Service for the backend (server directory).
Setting the necessary environment variables in Render (like your MONGODB_URI).
Creating a Static Site for the frontend (client directory).
Configuring the necessary build commands and publish directories.
Verify Deployment: Once both services are live, test the application to ensure the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend. You should be able to create and view tasks.
You may have to make some changes to the starter code to get it to work with the deployment guide, but that is part of the deployment experience!

Submission
Submit the live URLs for both your deployed frontend static site and your backend web service on Render.
Ensure your application is functional. A submission of non-working URLs will not receive full credit.
